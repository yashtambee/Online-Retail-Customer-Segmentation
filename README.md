This project aims to segment the customers of an online retail store based on their purchase history, demographics, and other relevant data. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy as it helps to identify the different groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors, which can be targeted with specific marketing campaigns to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

### Data

The data used in this project contains information on transactions made by customers of an online retail store based in the UK. The dataset has 541,909 rows and 8 columns, including the following variables:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number. A unique identifier for each transaction.
- StockCode: Product code. A unique identifier for each product.
- Description: Product description.
- Quantity: The number of items purchased in each transaction.
- InvoiceDate: The date and time when each transaction was generated.
- UnitPrice: The price of each item in pounds.
- CustomerID: Customer number. A unique identifier for each customer.
- Country: The country where the customer resides.

### Methodology

The customer segmentation is performed using a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques. The following steps are involved in the process:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data. The data is also transformed into a format suitable for analysis and modeling.

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The data is analyzed using various statistical and visualization techniques to understand the patterns and trends in the data.

3. Feature engineering: New features are created from the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

4. Model selection and training: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to select the best model for customer segmentation.

5. Model evaluation and interpretation: The selected model is evaluated using various metrics and interpreted to gain insights into the different customer segments.

### Results

The results of the customer segmentation are presented in a report that includes the following information:

- Overview of the customer segments: A brief summary of the different customer segments identified by the model.

- Characteristics of each customer segment: A detailed description of the demographic, behavioral, and transactional characteristics of each customer segment.

- Recommendations for marketing strategies: Based on the insights gained from the customer segmentation, recommendations are made for targeted marketing campaigns for each customer segment.
